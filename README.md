## Introducing WSO2 Data Analytics Server ##

WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.0.0 combines real-time, batch, interactive, and predictive (via machine learning) analysis of data into one integrated platform to support the multiple demands of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, as well as mobile and Web apps.

As a part of WSO2’s Analytics Platform, WSO2 DAS introduces a single solution with the ability to build systems and applications that collect and analyze both batch and realtime data to communicate results. It is designed to treat millions of events per second, and is therefore capable to handle Big Data volumes and Internet of Things projects.

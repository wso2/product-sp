<p>The aim of this simple tutorial is to explain how the TCPMon works. It
explains how messages are exchanged and other important features such as Slow
Connection Simulation and HTTP Proxy Support.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TCPMon is a utility that allows the user to monitor the messages passed
along in a TCP based conversation. It is based on a swing UI and works on
almost all the platforms that Java supports.</p>
The script file, tcpmon.{sh|bat} to run this tool is located in the "bin"
folder of the WSO2 AppServer distribution. <a id="dependencies"></a>

<h2>Structure and Dependencies</h2>

<p>TCPMon has absolutely no dependencies on third party libraries. TCPMon
needs a JRE that is 1.4 or higher.</p>
<a id="patterns"></a>

<h2>Usage Patterns</h2>
<a id="intermediate"></a>

<h3>As an Explicit Intermediate</h3>

<p>The most common usage pattern for the TCPMon is as an
<strong>intermediary</strong>. It is called <strong>explicit</strong> since
the client has to send the messages to the intermediary rather than to the
original endpoint in order to monitor the messages. The following figure
explains this concept.</p><br/><br/>

<p><img alt="Figure 1: concept" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_concept.jpg" /></p><br/><br/>

<p>In order to start the TCPMon in this configuration, you have to provide
the target host name and port as well as the listening port on the Admin tab.
See the image below.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 2: first screen" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_screen1.jpg" /></p><br/><br/>

<p>Click 'Add' to open a new tab that displays the messages to be seen, as
displayed in the following screen.</p><br/><br/>

<p><img alt="Figure 3: message screen" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_screen2.jpg" /></p><br/><br/>

<p>At this point, the requester should point to the listener port of the
TCPMon instead of the original endpoint. Let us understand this with an
example:</p>

<p>For example, we need to monitor all the messages that are sent to and from
www.apache.org.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Add a listener with the host as www.apache.org
and port as 80. Set the listener to port 8080, which may be any unused port
in the local machine.</p><br/><br/>

<p>
    <img alt="Figure 4: the settings" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_screen2-closeup2.jpg"/></p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Point the browser to the localhost:8080 instead
of www.apache.org.</p><br/><br/>

<p>

</p>

<p>Once the exchange of messages start, they can be seen on the relevant tab
as seen below.</p><br/><br/>

<p><img alt="Figure 6: Filled screen" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_screen3.jpg" /></p><br/><br/>

<p>The options at the bottom of the screen can be used to have the messages
in XML format (useful in debugging Web services), save and resend the
messages, and also to switch the layout of the message windows.</p><br/><br/>

<h3>As a Request Sender for Web Services</h3>

<p>TCPMon can also be used as a request sender for Web services. The request
SOAP message can be pasted on the send screen and then sent directly to the
server.</p><br/><br/>

<p><img alt="Figure 8: request sender" src="../images/tools/tcpmon_screen4.jpg" /></p> <br/><br/>
<a id="proxy"></a>

<h3>As a Proxy</h3>

<p>TCPMon can act as a proxy. To start the TCPMon in proxy mode, just select
the Proxy option. When acting as a proxy, TCPMon only needs the listener port
to be configured.</p> <br/><br/>

<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
<a id="slow"></a>

<h3>Slow Connection Simulation</h3>

<p>TCPMon can simulate a slow connection, in which case the delay and the
bytes to be dropped can be configured. This is specially useful in testing
Web services.</p> <br/><br/>

<a id="http_proxy"></a>

<h3>HTTP Proxy support</h3>

<p>If HTTP proxy support is required, then that can also be set on the admin
screen.</p>
<a id="conclusion"></a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>TCPMon is a simple and easy to use tool that has many benefits when
developing message driven applications. It is particularly useful in
developing Web services.</p>

System Requirements
-------------------
1. Minimum memory - 2GB

2. Java SE Development Kit 1.6.0_24 or higher

3. To build @product.name@ from the Source distribution, it is also necessary that you
   have Maven 3.0.3 or later.

4. Cygwin (Windows) - BAM analytics framework depends on Apache Hadoop and Hadoop requires Cygwin in order to run in Windows. So first make sure that you have at least installed basic, net (OpenSSH,tcp_wrapper packages) and security related Cygwin packages if you are working on Windows before using BAM.

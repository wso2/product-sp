@APP:name('sentimentExtensionSample')
/*
Purpose:
	This application demonstrates calculating the sentiment value for a given string as per Affin word list.

Prerequisites:
	1) Save this sample.
	2) If there is no syntax error, the following message is shown on the console:
	       * - Siddhi App sentimentExtensionSample successfully deployed.

Executing the Sample:
	1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
	2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages are shown on the console:
    	  * sentimentExtensionSample.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
           Send events through one or more of the following methods.

                  * You may send events to userWallPostStream, via event simulator
                      a) Open the event simulator by clicking on the second icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I.
                      b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, specify the values as follows:
                              * Siddhi App Name  : sentimentExtensionSample
                              * Stream Name      : userWallPostStream
                      c) In the userId and text fields, enter the following and then click Send to send the event.
                              userId: Mohan",
                              text: "David is a good person. David is a bad person"
                      d) Send another event.
                              userId: "Nuwan",
                              text:  "David is a good person."

                  * Send events to the simulator http endpoint through the curl commands:
                      a) Open a new terminal and issue the following commands one after the other:
                          curl -X POST \
                            http://localhost:9090/simulation/single \
                            -u admin:admin \
                            -H 'content-type: text/plain' \
                            -d '{
                            "siddhiAppName": "sentimentExtensionSample",
                            "streamName": "userWallPostStream",
                            "timestamp": null,
                            "data": [

                            ]
                          }'

                          curl -X POST \
                            http://localhost:9090/simulation/single \
                            -u admin:admin \
                            -H 'content-type: text/plain' \
                            -d '{
                            "siddhiAppName": "sentimentExtensionSample",
                            "streamName": "userWallPostStream",
                            "timestamp": null,

                      d) Set the following request body in text and send the first event.
                            	{"streamName": "userWallPostStream", "siddhiAppName": "sentimentExtensionSample",
                            	"data":  [
                                            "Mohan",
                                            "David is a good person. David is a bad person"
                                          ]}
                      d) If there are no errors, the following messages are shown on the console:
                            *  "status": "OK",
                            *  "message": "Single Event simulation started successfully"
                      e) Send another event by setting the request body in text
                                   {"streamName": "userWallPostStream", "siddhiAppName": "sentimentExtensionSample",
                                   "data":  [
                                              "Nuwan",
                                              "David is a good person."

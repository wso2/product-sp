        - password: senders password
        - to: receivers address (Ex:- 'example987@wso2.com')
        - subject: subject of the email
    2) You need to enable access to "less secure apps" in the sender's gmail account via "https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" link
    3) Save this sample

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
        * PublishEmailInXmlFormat.siddhi - Started Successfully!.

Testing the Sample:
    1) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab)
    2) Click 'Single Simulation' (this will be already selected)
    3) Select PublishEmailInXmlFormat as 'Siddhi App Name'
    4) Select SweetProductionStream as 'StreamName'

            - name: chocolate cake
            - amount: 10.10
    6) Click on the start button (Arrow symbol) next to the newly created simulator

Viewing the Results:
    Check the receiver gmail inbox (The gmail referred to in 'to' Sink configuration) to see the alert as follows.
        Subject: Alert
        Content: <events><event><name>chocolate cake</name><hourlyTotal>12.12</hourlyTotal><currentHour>0.0</currentHour></event></events>

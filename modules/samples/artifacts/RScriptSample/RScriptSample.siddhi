@App:description('Use a R script to process events and produce aggregated outputs based on the provided input variable parameters and expected output attributes.')
/*
Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to configure a Siddhi app to process events with a R script.

Prerequisites:
    1) Install R. See notes for more information see 'How to use
' in 'https://github.com/wso2-extensions/siddhi-gpl-execution-r/blob/master/README.md'
    2) Download siddhi-gpl-execution-r-x.x.x.jar and copy the jar to  {WSO2SPHome}/lib
        http://maven.wso2.org/nexus/content/repositories/wso2gpl/org/wso2/extension/siddhi/gpl/execution/r/siddhi-gpl-execution-r/
    3) Save this sample.
    4) If there is no syntax error, the following message is shown on the console:
    	       * - Siddhi App RScriptSample successfully deployed.

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console.
        * RScriptSample.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    Send events through one or more of the following methods.
        * You may send events to weather stream, via event simulator:
               a) Open the event simulator by clicking on the second icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I.
    	       b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, specify the values as follows:
                * Siddhi App Name  : RScriptSample
                * Stream Name     : weather
               c) Use the following values in the time and temp fields and send each value pair one after the other.
                    time: 10, temp:55.6
                    time: 20, temp:65.6
                    time: 30, temp:75.6

Viewing the Results:
    See the processed output for each event on the console.

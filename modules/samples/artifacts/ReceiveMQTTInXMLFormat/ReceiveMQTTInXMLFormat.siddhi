@App:description('Receive events via MQTT transport in XML format and view the output on the console.')

/*
Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to configure WSO2 Stream Processor  to receive events to the SweetProductionStream via MQTT transport in XML format and log the events in LowProductionAlertStream to the output console.

Prerequisites:
    1) Save this sample
        "Siddhi App ReceiveMQTTInXMLFormat successfully deployed" message would be shown in the console
    2) Before running this MQTT sample, set up mosquitto server which supports MQTT. This can be done by the following commands:
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install mosquitto
    3) After the set up ,start the mosquitto server by running the following command
        sudo service mosquitto start

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run', the following messages would be shown on the console.
            ReceiveMQTTInXMLFormat.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    Option1: Publish events with the command line publisher:
        Open a terminal and publish events using following command. (The values for name and amount attributes can be changed as desired)
        mosquitto_pub -t 'mqtt_topic_input' -m '<events><event><name>sugar</name><amount>300.0</amount></event></events>'

    Option2: Publish events with mqtt sample client:
        Open a terminal and navigate to <WSO2_SP_HOME>/samples/sample-clients/mqtt-client
        Run the following command in the terminal:
            ant
        If you want to publish custom number of events, you need to run "ant" command as follows
            ant -DnoOfEventsToSend=5

Viewing the Results:
    See the output. Following message would be shown on the console.
    ReceiveHTTPInXMLFormatWithDefaultMapping : LowProducitonAlertStream : Event{timestamp=1511938781887, data=[sugar, 300.0], isExpired=false}
Note:
    Stop this Siddhi application
    Stop the mosquitto server using following command once you are done with the execution.
        sudo service mosquitto stop

@App:name("Store-redis")
@App:description("Receive events via simulator and received data are persisted in store.")

/*

Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations using Siddhi queries in Redis stores. The sample depicts a scenario in a sweet production factory. The sweet production details such as name of the raw material, amount used for production can be stored using insertSweetProductionStream. The following streams can be used to search, delete, update or upsert(update or insert) the existing data in the store
    Search - searchSweetProductionStream
    insert - insertSweetProductionStream
    delete - deleteSweetProductionStream
    update - updateSweetProductionStream
    update or insert - updateOrInsertSweetProductionStream
    contains - containsSweetProductionStream (verifies whether all the attributes that enter in the stream exists in the store).


Prerequisites:
    (1) Download the Redis from https://redis.io/
    (2) Download redis java client 'Jedis' jar(>2.7.0) from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/redis.clients/jedis and place in <SP_HOME>/lib folder
    (3) In redis.conf, provide the requirepass as root.
    (4) Start redis by redis-server <path-to-redis.conf>

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
        * Store-redis.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    1) Simulate single events. For this, click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab) -> 'Single Simulation' -> Select 'Store-redis' as 'Siddhi App Name' -> Select 'searchSweetProductionStream' as 'Stream Name' -> Provide attribute values -> Send
    2) Send at-least one event with the single event simulator, where the name matches a name value in the data we previously inserted to the SweetProductionTable. This would satisfy the 'on' condition of our join query.
    3) Likewise the events can be sent to the other corresponding streams to add, delete, update, insert, search events.
    4) After a change in the store, using the search stream the developer can see whether the operation is successful.
    5) Primary Key constraint SweetProductionTable is disabled, since name cannot be used as a PrimaryKey in ProductionTable.
       Siddhi functions can be used to create a unique id for the received events which can then be used to apply Primary Key constraint on the data store records. (http://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-4.0/#function)

Viewing the Results:
    See the output for row materials on the console. Inserted, deleted, updated events can be checked by searchSweetProductionStream.

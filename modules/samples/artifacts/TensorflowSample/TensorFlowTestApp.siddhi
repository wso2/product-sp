@App:name("TensorFlowTestApp")
/*
Purpose:
	This application demonstrates how to import a pretrained Tensorflow model WSO2 Stream Processor to perform a regression task.

Prerequisites:
    1) Replace {SP_HOME} with absolute path to the Stream Processor home directory.
	2) Save this sample.
	3) If there is no syntax error, the following message is shown on the console:
	       * - Siddhi App TensorFlowTestApp successfully deployed.

Executing the Sample:
	1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
	2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages are shown on the console:
    	  * TensorFlowTestApp.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
           Send events through one or more of the following methods.

                  * You may send events to ProductionInputStream, via event simulator
                      a) Open the event simulator by clicking on the second icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I.
                      b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, specify the values as follows:
                              * Siddhi App Name  : TensorFlowTestApp
                              * Stream Name      : InputStream
                      c) In the x field, enter the following and then click Send to send the event.
                              x: "double:[1,-2]"

                      d) Send some more events.

                  * Send events to the simulator http endpoint through the curl command:
                      a) Open a new terminal and issue the following command:
                          * curl -X POST -d '{"streamName": "InputStream", "siddhiAppName": "TensorFlowTestApp","data": 'double:[1,-2]'}' http://localhost:9390/simulation/single -H 'content-type: text/plain'
                      b) If there is no error, the following messages are shown on the terminal:
                          *  {"status":"OK","message":"Single Event simulation started successfully"}

                  * Publish events with Postman:
                      a) Install 'Postman' application from Chrome web store.
                      b) Launch the application.
                      c) Make a 'Post' request to the 'http://localhost:9390/simulation/single' endpoint. Set the Content-Type to 'text/plain' and set the request body in text as follows:
                            	{"streamName": "InputStream", "siddhiAppName": "TensorFlowTestApp","data": 'double:[1,-2]'}
                      d) Click 'send'. If there is no error, the following messages are shown on the console:
                            *  "status": "OK",
                            *  "message": "Single Event simulation started successfully"

Viewing the Results:
    See the output on the terminal.

Inside each sub-directory in this directory there is a sample that can be used to understand 
functionality of the WSO2 BAM server. Each sample sub-directory contains a README file that
contains instructions to run the sample. For more documentation on samples (with additional
illustrations), please refer http://docs.wso2.org/wiki/display/BAM240/Samples.

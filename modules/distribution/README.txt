Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
==========================================================

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration.
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to
secure them with default mode.

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool
	script from bin directory.

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class.

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory.

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key)

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)

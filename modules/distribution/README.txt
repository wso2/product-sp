WSO2 DAS is powered by WSO2 Carbon, the SOA middleware component platform. 

New Features
============

	- Cross-tenant analytics support for the super tenant

	- Ability to use any data type as a facet field

	- Various bug fixes and improvements

For a full list of improvements over DAS 3.0.1, please write to us at dev@wso2.org.

Features
========

*Data aggregation	
    Receives data from event sources through Java agents (Thrift, Kafka, JMS), JavaScript clients (Web Sockets, REST), to IoT (MQTT), and also from WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus Connectors.
    Publishes events to one API for real-time, batch or interactive processing.
    Ability to access the analytics service via comprehensive REST API.

*Integrated, real-time, and batch analytics
    Analyses both persisted and realtime data using a single product.
    Executes batch programs faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory using Apache Spark.
    Detects patterns (fraud detection) by correlating events from multiple data sources in real time using the high performing, open source WSO2 CEP engine powered by WSO2 Siddhi.

*Interactive analytics and edge analytics
    Searches for full text, complex query lookup, distributed indexing support using Apache Lucene for interactive analytics.
    Correlates/filters events at the edge for edge analytics.

*High level language and data storage
    Use of a structured easy to learn SQL-like query language.
    Develops complex real-time queries using SQL-like Siddhi query language.
    Scalable analytic querying using Spark SQL.
    Support for RDBMS (MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL) as data storages for low to medium scale enterprise deployments.
    Support for HBase and Cassandra as NoSQL storage for Big Data enterprise deployments.

*Extensibility using C-Apps
    Industry/domain-specific toolboxes to extend the product for business use cases such as fraud detection, GIS data monitoring, activity monitoring etc.
    Ability to install C-Apps for each WSO2 middleware product, including the analytics functionality available with WSO2 API Manager.

*Communication
    Customizable dashboards that provide an at-a-glance view as well as an detail view.
    Detects conditions and generate realtime alerts and notifications (email, SMS, push notifications, physical sensor alarms etc.)
    Exposes event tables as an API via WSO2 API Manager and WSO2 Data Services Server.

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
==========================================================

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration.
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to
secure them with default mode.

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool
	script from bin directory.

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class.

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory.

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key)

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)

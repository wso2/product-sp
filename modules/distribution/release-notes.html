	<p>WSO2 Data Analytics Server development team is pleased to announce the release of WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.1.0</p>

	<p>WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.1.0 combines real-time, batch, interactive, and predictive (via machine learning) analysis of data into one integrated platform to support the multiple demands of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, as well as mobile and Web apps.</p>

	<p>As a part of WSO2&rsquo;s analytics platform, WSO2 DAS introduces a single solution with the ability to build systems and applications that collect and analyze both realtime and persisted, data and communicate the results. It is designed to treat millions of events per second, and is therefore capable to handle Big Data volumes and Internet of Things projects.</p>

	<p>WSO2 DAS is powered by <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon" class="externalLink">WSO2 Carbon</a>, the SOA middleware component platform.</p>

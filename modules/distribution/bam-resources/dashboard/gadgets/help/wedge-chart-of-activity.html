	<h1>Activity Information Gadget</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This gadget shows the realtime information such as number of requests,responses,faults and the time of average,minimum,maximum responses of operations and the number of messages(shows the messageID) of a given activity.Inner circle represents the operations, while outer circle represents the messages. Simply point the mouse over the graph to see extended information.</p>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<p>Click on the 'Configuration' tab and select the activity to monitor.</p>
	<h3>Note:-</h3>
	Since we haven't implemented the logic to calculate the accurate stats for an activity in terms of operation, the "Operation" stats related to an activity will show the generic data of that operation. It is not accurate for that particular activity. There are no stats for messages as the stats are undefined.
